 BOLD LOVELL

As Lovell was out riding out across the misty mountains
He spied two merchants, their money they was counting
He took out his pistol, and he gave to them no warning
He stole all their money and he bade them both good morning

Chorus
Oh, the devil's in the women so they say,
But how the devil can a fellow let 'em be

He went to a public house and counted out his money
He called on the landlady and asked for pretty Polly
But while they was talking, and thinking of no matter
She stole away his pistol and she filled it up with water

Chorus

As Lovell and Polly were taking their sweet pleasure
In walked the troopers saying "Lovell, you must leave her
For a long time you've been on the road to the gallows
So some along with us young man and be a decent fellow

Chorus

He reached for his pistols but they wouldn't fire for water
The beat him so cruelly and the gave to him no quarter
Polly, she cried, "If I'd known that they was coming,
I'd have fought them like a tiger, just as sure as I'm a woman

Chorus

"I have two brothers and they're in the Marines
One of them's at Chatham and the other one's at sea
Bold, frisk and lively lads, and champions of folly
I'd rather they was here today than you deceitful Polly

Chorus

As Lovell was climbing up that old gallows ladder
He called out so gaily for his highway cap and feather
"Well, I've always been a lively lad, but never murdered any
I think it bloody hard to swing for liftin' a bit of money!

Chorus
