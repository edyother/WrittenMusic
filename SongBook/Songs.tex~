\subsection{The Banks of Newfoundland}

\noindent
Ye ramblin boys of Liverpool, ye sailormen beware
\\When you go 'board a Yankee Packet ship no dungaree jumpers wear
\\But hav yourself a monkey coat, and keep it close to hand
\\For there blow some cold Norwesters on the Banks of Newfoundland
\\\textit{We'll scrape her and we'll scrub her, with holystone and sand
\\And we'll say farewell fot the virgin rocks on the Banks of Newfoundland}

\noindent
\\We had one Lynch from Ballynahinch, Spud Murphy and Mike Moore
\\'Twas in the winter of Sevently Three, those sea boys suffered sore
\\They Pawned their gear in Liverpool, they sold it out of hand
\\Not thinking on them cold nor winds on the Banks of Newfoundland

\noindent
\\We had a lady fair aboard, Kate Connor was her name
\\To her I'd promised marriage, and on me she had her claim
\\She tore her flannel petticoat to make mittens for my hands
\\For she could not see her true love freeze on the Banks of Newfoundland

\noindent
\\I dreamed a dream the other night, and I thought I was at home
\\Along side me my own true love, and she in Marlebone
\\A jug of ale upon my knee, and a glass in my hand
\\But when I awoke my heart was broke on the Banks of Newfoundland

\subsection{Rolling Down the River}

\noindent
\textbf{Once I was a Rigger and I worked like hell}
\\Rolling up, rolling down
\\\textbf{But now I'm sailing with the OCL, to go}
\\Rolling down the river
\\Rolling up, rolling down
\\We all get drunk in Tillbury Town
\\Twenty four hours to turn around and go
\\Rolling down the River

\noindent
\\\textbf{When first I saw a TEU}
\\\textbf{I wondered where they stowed the crew, to go}

\noindent
\\\textbf{Cargo comes in TEUs}
\\\textbf{A twenty foot box boys filled with booze, to go}

\noindent
\\\textbf{There's a Tillbury girl called Kettle Jane}
\\\textbf{She's first on the boil, then off again, to go}

\noindent
\\\textbf{She's got a mate called Teapot Anne}
\\\textbf{She gets well brewed just like a man, to go}

\noindent
\\\textbf{Down by the dockgates where the work is done}
\\\textbf{You can pick those girls up one by one and go}

\noindent
\\\textbf{Well we are the bullies that'll see her through}
\\\textbf{So to hell with the Channel and the TEU, well go}
