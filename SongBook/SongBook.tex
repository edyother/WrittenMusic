Ye ramblin' boys of Liverpool, ye sailormen beware \\
When you go 'board a Yankee Packet ship no dungaree jumpers wear \\
But have yourself a monkey coat, and keep it close to hand \\
For there blow some cold Norwesters on the Banks of Newfoundland \\
\textbf{We'll scrape her and we'll scrub her, with holystone and sand \\
And we'll say farewell to the virgin rocks on the Banks of Newfoundland} \\

We had one Lynch from Ballynahinch, Spud Murphy and Mike Moore \\
'Twas in the winter of Sevently Three, those sea boys suffered sore \\
They Pawned their gear in Liverpool, they sold it out of hand \\
Not thinking on them cold nor winds on the Banks of Newfoundland \\

We had a lady fair aboard, Kate Connor was her name \\
To her I'd promised marriage, and on me she had her claim \\
She tore her flannel petticoat to make mittens for my hands \\
For she could not see her true love freeze on the Banks of Newfoundland \\

I dreamed a dream the other night, and I thought I was at home \\
Along side me my own true love, and she in Marlebone \\
A jug of ale upon my knee, and a glass in my hand \\
But when I awoke my heart was broke on the Banks of Newfoundland \\

Barrett's Privateers\\

Oh the year was seventeen seventy eight \\
\textbf{How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now} \\
When a letter of mark came from the king \\
to the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen \\
\textbf{God damn them all, I was told \\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold \\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears \\
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier \\
The last of Barrett's Privateers} \\

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town \\
For twenty brave men, all fishermen who \\
would make for him the Antelope's crew \\

Oh, the Antelope sloop was a sickening sight \\
She'd a list to port and sails in rags \\
And a cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags \\

On the king's birthday we put to sea \\
It was ninety one days to Montego Bay \\
We were pumping like madmen all the way \\

On the ninety sixth day we sailed again \\
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight \\
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight \\

Oh, the Yankee lay low down with gold \\
She was broad and fat and loose in stays \\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days \\

At length we stood two cables away \\
Our cracked four punders made and awful din \\
But with one fat ball the yank stove us in \\

Oh, the Antelope shook and pitched on her side \\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs \\
And the main truck carried off both me legs \\

So here I lay in my twenty third year \\
Well it's been six years since I sailed away \\
And I just made Halifax yesterday \\

A Blacksmith courted me, nine months and better \\
He fairly one my heart, wrote me a letter \\
With his hammer in his hand he looked quite clever \\
And if I was with my love, I'd live forever \\

But where has my love gone, with his cheeks like roses \\
And his good black billycock on, all decked 'round with primroses \\
I'm afraid the scorching sun will shine, and burn his beauty \\
And if I was with my love, I'd do my duty \\

Strange news has come to town, strange news is carried \\
Strange news flies up and down, that my love is married \\
I wish them both much joy, though they can't hear me \\
And may God reward him well for the slighting of me \\

Don't you remember when you lay beside me? \\
And you said you'd marry me, and not deny me \\
If I said I'd marry you, it was only for to try you \\
So bring your witness love, and I'll not deny you \\

But witness have I none, save God almighty \\
And may he reward you well for the slighting of me \\
Her lips grew pale and wan, it made her poor heart to tremble \\
To think she'd loved the one, and he proved deceitful \\

My name is McShane from the plains of Kildare \\
A farmer I was until the last year \\
Till I took a notion oh via promotion \\
Went over to England the harvest the shear \\

\textbf{Rum toora la rum toora laddie \\
Rum toora la musha rum toora lay} \\

I parted with money so blithe and so jolly \\
Picked up a stick for a staff in me hand \\
And to keep myself cheery for fear I'd get weary \\
I sang Paddywhack as I went on my way. \\

I landed at Dumbarton on a fine summers evening \\
Me bundle and staff I held them in me hands \\
There were some of them laughing and some of them chaffin' \\
More of them trying to stick Paddy away. \\

I went into a woman to ask her for lodgings \\
She said "Me young man, now don't look so dull! \\
For I will tell you where you will get lodgings \\
With a woman who lives next door to The Black Bull. \\

So I went to this woman and asked her for lodgings \\
She instantly showed me to a bed in a room \\
And I being so tired and worn out from walking \\
I threw myself down on me bed in the room. \\

But a lump of a Tinker lay up in the corner \\
He swore 'pon his soul sure he'd kill all was there \\
Says I "Me bold Tinker, give over your braggin', \\
I'm bold McShane from the plains of Kildare!" \\

But he tried for to hit me a punch in the stomach \\
I instantly fetched him a one in the throat \\
And he tumbled heels over his head in the corner \\
And put all his head in an old rusty pot. \\

He lay on the floor like a sheep he was bleeding \\
I swore 'pon my soul sure I'd cut off his life \\
But I lifted him up and sent down for to Megan \\
Me and the Tinker we ended the strife. \\

I can handle a harpoon, I cuts a fine figure  \\
Whenever I gets in a ship’s standing room \\

I went to a dance one night in old Tomby’s \\
There were plenty of girls as fine as you’d wish \\
And one fat old thing she was chewing tobacco \\
Just like a young kitten a-chewing fresh fish \\

Well they took away me brouges and they robbed me of my spade \\
Put me in the Army and a soldier of me made \\
But I could not beat the drum and I could not play the flute \\
So they put me in the Army and they taught me how to shoot  \\

Then they put me on a ship and they sent me home again \\
With all the Army's training after battle strife and then \\
Well we headed for the down and we landed at the keys \\
Me mother came to see me and these words did say to me \\
Oh Felix were you drunk, and Felix were you mad \\
oh what has become of the fine two legs you had? \\

Well I bid my spade adieu, for I could not dig the bog \\
But I can play my fiddle and I can drink my grog \\
I've learned to smoke a pipe, and I can fire a gun \\
To the devil with the fighting I am glad this war is done \\

Why there goes Jack Sprat, the poor sailor lad, he must go to sea once more \\

I hung my nets upon a tree \\
And I scanned the moonlit bay \\
All the boys were out, and the red coats too \\
I kissed my wife good-bye \\
And through the shade of the greenwood glade \\
I followed Henry Joy \\

It was for Ireland's cause we fought \\
For home and sire, we bled \\
Though our hearts were true, and our numbers were few \\
And ten to one lay dead \\
And many a lassie mourned her lad \\
And mother mourned her boy \\
For the youth was strong in the daring throng \\
That followed Henry Joy \\

In Belfast town they built a tree \\
And the redcoats mustered there \\
I saw him come as the sound of a drum \\
Rolled out on the barrack square \\
He kissed his sister and went aloft \\
He bade his last good-bye \\
He turned and died, My God, I cired \\

The first thing Jack requires is a fiddler to his hand \\
Likewise the best liquor of every kind \\
And a pretty girl likewise with two dark and rolling eyes \\
And Jacky he is suited to his mind \\

The landlady she comes in dressed all in her Sunday best \\
She looks like some bright and morning star \\
She’s ready to wait on him when she finds he’s plenty of tin \\
Chalk him down to the one behind the bar \\

His wages were soon gone and his friends they are all flown \\
And the flash girls, they departed for another \\
And the landlady, she cried pay your score and get outside \\
Your cargo’s gone and you’ve hit stormy weather \\

Now Jack all in his rage he threw bottles at her head \\
And likewise all the glasses he let fly \\
And the poor girl in her fright called the watchman of the night \\
Saying take this young sailor lad away \\

Now Jack did understand that a ship lay wanting hands \\
And to her he went straight down \\
With a sweet and pleasant gale he unfurled his lofty sail \\
And bid adieu to the flash girls of the town \\

So he laid her on a tack like a cutter or smack \\
As she rolled from the lee to the weather \\
And he kept a full on eye close to the wind as she would lie \\
We were bound for black wall and stormy weather \\

Mauling Live Oak\\

One day I was traveling I happened to think \\
My pockets are empty, I can't buy a drink \\
I am an old bummer completely dead broke \\
There's nothing to do but go mauling live oak \\
\textbf{Derry down, down, down derry down} \\

So I went right away for to meet Captain Swift \\
To see and find out could he give me a lift \\
He looked me all over, from top unto toe \\
He said you're the boy who live oaking must go \\

He brought out the contract which both of us signed \\
To keep and secure if we both were inclined \\
But the very best wages that he could afford \\
'Twas only five dollars a month and my board \\

So I had to get ready without much delay \\
For the schooner was sailing the very next day \\
With two pints of whiskey, a pipe and a spoon \\
Away we set sail for mosquito lagoon \\

Bluff was the game that we played every night \\
And in it Charles Douglas he took great delight \\
He won my tobacco while others cracked jokes \\
He said you'll get more when you're mauling live oak \\

Well mauling this live oak, I'll say it's great fun \\
Especially the dry ones that makes the sweat run \\
It'll make your axe handles to glimmer and smoke \\
You need iron handles for mauling live oak \\

It's mosquitoes by day and it's minges by night \\
The sand fleas and bed bugs they bother me quite \\
And if ever back home, my head I do poke \\
To Hell I'll kick Swift and his God damn live oak \\

He give me a plate of American hash, and calls it Liverpool scouse \\
He said there's a ship that's wanting hands, and on her you must sign \\
The mate's a bastard, the bosun's worse, but she will suit you fine \\

So I turned around to the window and I furled the window blind \\

Paddy he piped “All hands on deck, their stations for to man” \\
His wife, she stood in the doorway, with a bucket in her hand \\
Paddy he cried “Now let her rip” and she flung the water our way \\
Saying “Clew up yer 'fore t'gansls boys, she's takin' in the spray” \\

Since your headed away to the south me boys, to Frisco you are bound \\
Paddy he called for a length of rope and layed on the ground \\
He had us step over and back again and he says to me “that's fine” \\
And if ever they ask was you ever at sea, you can say you've crossed the line \\

There's only one thing left that you must do before you sail away \\
Walk around the table, where the bullocks horn does lay \\
And if ever they ask, was you ever at sea, you can say ten times 'round the Horn \\

Cut a stout blackthorn, to banish ghost and goblin \\
Brand new pair of brogues, to rattle over the bogs \\
And frightening all the dogs On the rocky road to Dublin \\

Started by daylight, me spirits blythe and airy \\
Took a drop of the pure to keep me heart from sinking \\
That's the Paddy's cure whene'er he's out for drinking \\
To see the lassies smile, laughing all the while \\
At me curious style set your hear a bubblin' \\
Asked me was I hired the wages I required \\
Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin \\

In Dublin next arrived I thought it such a pity \\
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city \\
So then I took a stroll all among the quality \\
Bundle it was stole in a neat locality \\
Something crossed me mind And when I looked behind \\
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobbling \\
Inquiring after the rogue they said me Connaught brogue \\
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin \\

So then I get away me spirits never failing \\
Landed on the Quay just as the ship was sailing \\
Captain at me roared said I've no room Paddy \\
As I jumped aboard a cabin found for Paddy \\
Down among the pigs, did some funny rigs \\
We danced some hearty jigs water 'round me bubbling \\
Off of Holy Head, wished m'self was dead \\
Better far instead down the rocky road to Dublin \\

The boys of Liverpool when we safely landed \\
Called m'self a fool I could no longer stand it \\
Blood began to boil, temper I was loosing \\
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing \\
Hurrah me soul says I, a shillelagh I let fly \\
Some Gallway boy were by as I was a hobbling \\
With a loud Hurray they joined me in the fray \\

With my bold conversation they seemed but not afraid \\
While such fine things I sold to them they came to understand \\

I went into a tavern and there all night I stayed \\
The landlady's fair daughter of me was not afraid \\
She held me and she kissed me, she took me by the hand \\
And shyly told her momma that she loved the peddler man \\

But early the next morning as I was going away \\
The landlady's fair daughter these words to me did say \\
"How can you be so cruel and treat me so unkind \\
And go onece more a roaming and to leave me here behind" \\

But I'll leave off my peddling and I'll take to me a wife \\
For with this handsome fair maid I'd gladly spend my life \\
I'll embrace her late and early and do the best I can \\

Oh if I had the wings of a goney boys I'd spread 'em and fly home \\
I'd leave all of Greenland's icy shores, for the right whale here is none \\
Oh the weather's rough and the winds do blow, and there's little comfort here \\
I'd rather be snug in a Deptford pub a-drinking a strong beer \\

Oh a man must be mad or wanting money bad to go venture catching whales \\
For he may be drowned when the fish turns around or his head smashed in by its' tail \\
They world seems grand to a young greenhand, and his heart is high when he goes \\
In a very short burst he'd as soon as hear a curse as the cry of "There she blows" \\

All hands on deck, now for God's sake, move quickly if you can \\
Oh he stumbles on deck, so dizzy and so sick, for his life he don't give a damn \\
High overhead the great flukes spread, and the mate gives the whale the iron \\
And soon the blood, in purple flood, from his spout all comes a-flyin' \\

Oh these trials we bare for neigh on four years, till our flyin' jib points to home \\
We're supposed for our toil to get a bonus on the oil, and an equal share of the bone \\
So we go to the agent to settle for our debt, and it's there we have cause to repent \\
For we've slaved away four years of our lives, and we've earned about three pounds ten \\

The Wreck of the Lady Washington\\

It was nineteen hundred and ninety one On October the seventeenth day \\
When the gallant ship, The Lady Washington \\
From Pasco sailed away (brave souls), \\
From Pasco sailed away. \\

The lookout on the foremast peak Teddy Keyes so young and fair \\
He would guide them under The railroad bridge, \\
With only four feet to spare (brave souls), \\
With only four feet to spare. \\

They were one hundred feet From the railroad bridge When a green light turned to red \\
“Reverse engines, come about”, Ted cried out \\
“The bridge is coming down ahead” (brave souls), \\
“The bridge is coming down ahead”. \\

They were doing four knots And the current was swift, That ship just could not stop. \\
Captain Sandy pulled the tiller, And he turned her half around, \\
As the bridge continued to drop (brave souls), \\
As the bridge continued to drop. \\

As the bridge came down The lookout aloft Tried to push that bridge away. \\
It was a reflex thing And he knew that it was dumb, \\
But he tried it anyway (brave souls), \\
He tried it anyway. \\

And the bridge came down She was struck broadside, And the mainmast and gaff did crack \\
But she didn't capsize, And no lives were lost, \\
And she'll probably never come back (any more), \\
She'll probably never come back. \\

The twenty six passengers Aboard that ship were shaken, dazed and pale. \\
They never reached Umatilla that day \\
But they'll never forget that sail (brave souls) \\
They'll never forget that sail. \\

“To lose our mast”, the captain said, “It grieves my heart full sore, \\
But to be struck down by a railroad bridge, \\
It grieves me ten times more (brave souls), \\
It grieves me ten times more.” \\

Oh Pasco is a dreadful place it's a land that's seldom green, \\
Where the dust storms blow, and the trains come and go, \\
But the tall ships are seldom seen (brave souls). \\
The tall ships are seldom seen. \\

You are my Sunshine\\

\textbf{You are my sunshine, my only sunshine \\
You make me happy when skies are grey \\
You'll never know dear, how much I love you \\
Please don't take my sunshine away} \\

The other night dear, as  I lay sleeping \\
I dreamed I held you in my arms \\
But when I woke dear, I was mistaken \\
And I hung my head down, and cried \\

You told me once dear, that you loved me \\
That nothing else could come between \\
But you've gone and left me for another \\
And you've shattered all of my dreams \\

I'll always love you and make you happy \\
If you'll only say the same \\
But if you leave me for another \\
You'll regret it all someday \\
